Background Color Changer 🌈
Welcome to the Background Color Changer project! This is a simple and fun web page that changes its background color every time you click a button. It's a great starting point for anyone learning JavaScript.

How It Works ✨
The page contains a button that, when clicked, triggers a JavaScript function. This function generates a random number, converts it to a hexadecimal format, adds a "#" to create a hex code, and then sets it as the background color of the page.

Usage 🚀
To use this page:

Open the index.html file in your web browser.
Click the button to change the background color.
You can also check out the live demo of the project here.
