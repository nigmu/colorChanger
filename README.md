# Background Color Changer

This is a simple web page that changes its background color when a button is clicked. This project is my first take on JavaScript.

## How it works

The page contains a button that, when clicked, triggers a JavaScript function. This function generates a random number which is then converted to hexadecimal format and a "#" is added to the front to create a hex code and sets it as the background color of the page.

## Usage

To use this page, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser and click the button to change the background color.
